# ⚙️ Unit Testing


## Introduction
Unit testing is essential for ensuring the reliability and maintainability of software. It helps catch defects early in development, reduces debugging time, and encourages better coding practices. However, poorly written tests can be costly and provide little value.

## Common Unit Testing Approaches

**Test-Driven Development (TDD): Writing tests before implementation.**
- ✅ &nbsp; Pros: Clear requirements, cleaner code, higher test coverage.
- ✅ &nbsp; Cons: Steeper learning curve, initially slower progress.

**Behavior-Driven Development (BDD): Focuses on specifying behavior clearly.**
- ✅ &nbsp; Pros: Clearer communication, encourages collaboration.
- ✅ &nbsp; Cons: Requires significant upfront effort.

**Post-development Unit Testing: Writing tests after implementation.**
- ✅ &nbsp; Pros: Faster initial coding.
- ✅ &nbsp; Cons: Often incomplete tests, harder-to-maintain code.
