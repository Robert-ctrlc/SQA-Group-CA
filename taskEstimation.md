# 📘 Task Estimation in Scrum

## Introduction
Estimating tasks is a crucial part of the development process. There are many techniques (), but while the goal of task estimation is to help teams efficiently plan and execute the sprint, sometimes difficulties and complications can occur. Many of the developers express their frustration with traditional estimation techniques, particularly story points, which are often seen as unreliable and wasteful.

**Description:** Various techniques for task estimation

Given the fast-paced nature and agility of our startup, we need a simple and efficient estimation method that balances accuracy with agility. Based on developer feedback, we set on the T-shirt sizing as our standardized estimation technique.

## 🚫 &nbsp;Common Pitfalls
- ❌ Assigning sizes without team discussion - if just one person is involved in the task measurement, the estimation may be inaccurate
- ❌ Skipping comparison to previous experiences - remember to look back and reference 
- ❌ Assuming T-shirt sizes map directly to hours - trying to convert sizes to exact time estimates defeats the purpose of relative sizing
