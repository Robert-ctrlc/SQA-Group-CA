# 📘 Code Reviews

## Introduction
Code review is a crucial part of the development process, it ensures the bugs don’t go into production and allows for maintaining high-quality software, and beyond the technical benefits, also promotes knowledge-sharing among the team members. However, common challenges developers face include code reviews becoming bottlenecks, feeling personally attacked by feedback on the pull requests, and reviewers becoming overwhelmed with work or focusing on less important issues instead of impactful improvements.

In our startup, we want to find a balance to ensure code quality while keeping reviews fast and constructive. Below we outline our best practices and common mistakes and things to avoid for efficient code reviews.
