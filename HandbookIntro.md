# Software Quality Assurance Handbook 

Welcome to our Eningeering Team's Quality Assurance Handbook.

With our team growing in a fast-paced, collaborative environment, this handbook reinforces standards on software quality. It is designed as a go-to resource for both newcomers and existing team members to learn how we do things; the right way.

## ðŸŽ¯&nbsp; What is the Purpose?

This handbook was created to:
- Ensure team-wide alignment on a shared set of  software quality practices  
- Improve communication and minimise defects, reowrk and inconsistencies
- Implement quality proactively, not reactively
- Make the onboarding process efficient, clear and consistent 

> The goal is **not** to impede our progress, but to deliver quality with focus; **as a team**.
